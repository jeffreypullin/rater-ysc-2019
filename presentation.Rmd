## The problem

Need a model which:

* Predicts latent class (with uncertainty!)

* Incoporates information (a priori and data driven) about the raters accuracy

Also:

* We need to understand how the model performs in range of situations

* We need software (R package) to fit the model

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Our solution

---

## The model: Dawid and Skene

First proposed in 1981, designed for biostatistical data, fit through EM

#### Benefits:

* Models a categorical latent class; produces probabilites of all the item 
  belonging to each of the classes

* Models the raters accuracy directly and in a flexible way 

* Minimal yet flexible (except for some conditional independence assumptions)

We implement a Bayesian version using NUTS through **Stan** to fit
the models

Extensively used in the Natural Langauge Processing literature

## Simulations

TODO: which are the best simulations?

Some writing and some more writing about our amazing simulations

* Some dot points

* and another

We will have these as plots so we can control the formatting more precisely

.pull-left[

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Placeholder until we have better plots
"/Users/jeffreypullin/Documents/papers/rater/paper/figures/figure_2.pdf" %>% 
  image_read() %>%
  image_scale("300")
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Placeholder until we have better plots
"/Users/jeffreypullin/Documents/papers/rater/paper/figures/figure_3.pdf" %>% 
  image_read() %>%
  image_scale("300")
```

## An R package: rater

Uses the probablistic progamming language **Stan** as a computational backend.
Designed to be:

* User friendly / well documented
* Good software (testing, CI, etc.)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#remotes::install_github(jeffreypullin/rater)
library(rater)
```

```{r, cache = TRUE, include = FALSE}
library(rater)
# For the purposes of the talk we hide data load/conversion issues
skin <- readRDS("/Users/jeffreypullin/Documents/R/paper/data/skin.rds")
skin <- long_data(skin)
skin_fit <- rater(skin, dawid_skene())
```

Model fitting:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
skin_fit <- rater(skin, dawid_skene())
```

Parameter extraction:
```{r}
extract_pi(skin_fit) %>% round(2)
```

---
## An R package: rater

Plotting:
```{r, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4, fig.align = "center"}
plot(skin_fit, type = "theta", which = 1)
```
